# React- Todo List ✔️
 <br>

#### This is one of the first projects I've done with React.js . In the project, the user can add the to-do list, edit the job, strikethrough the completed job, or delete the completed job. This project was completed using HTML, CSS and React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience the basic React.js features. <br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- Using React hooks

<br>
